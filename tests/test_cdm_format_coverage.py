"""FORMAT_COVERAGE.md claims the CDM carries what CoT, STANAG 4676 and GeoJSON need.

A mapping table is a promise to whoever writes the next adapter, and an unchecked promise about
field names rots on the first rename. So every path in the table's CDM column is resolved
against the real Pydantic models here. A renamed or removed field fails the build, which means
the table can be read as a specification rather than as a historical document.

The resolver walks pydantic annotations rather than dictionaries, so `Track.samples[].position.lat`
is checked all the way down to the float.
